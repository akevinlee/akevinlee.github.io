### Micro Focus Release Control plugin for Jenkins 2.x
This plugin allows Micro Focus Release Control to be used in Jenkins Pipelines. It provides the following adhoc build steps:

 - Create Release Package
 - Get Release Train State
 - Ger Release Package State
 - Send ALF Event

Micro Focus Release Control can be used across the development lifecycle but is typically used to automate releases into controlled environments (Staging/Pre-Prod/Production) and has additional enterprise capabilities above and beyond Jenkins to support this.
