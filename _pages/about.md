I have over 25 years of experience in defining, architecting and implementing software technology solutions. I started my career as a **Developer**
and still try to cut some code when I can (mainly _Java_, modern _JVM_ languages like Go and some front end _JavaScript_) - you can see some of
see some of my efforts on my [code](/code) page. 

For many years I have also been interested not just in the machinations of coding but in the supporting processes of developing, building 
and deploying modern software applications. Through practical experience I became something of a **Build and Release** expert and went on to publish a number
of articles and books on the topic - see my [publications](/publications) page.  

I am currently helping companies implement **Enterprise DevOps** - a natural extension of my Build and Release experience but moving more
into **Operations**, **Infrastructure** and modern development shifts such as **Cloud** and **Containerization**.

I have worked for many large IT companies (_GEC_, _Siemens_, _Ericsson_, _Rational Software_, _IBM_, _Micro Focus_) and so I am well versed in the 
challenges faced by large _Enterprise_ organisations adapting to the pace of change of the modern application development lifecycle. Being based in the UK, 
I have also worked extensively with _Financial Service_ organisations who have their own innate challenges of innovating, developing and deploying
faster whilst still retaining the level of goverance and control that their industry requires.

On this site you will find links and downloads to [templates](/templates), [publications](/publications), [presentations](/presentations), [code](/code) 
and other collateral that I have created over the years. 

Please feel free to contact me via any of the channels over on the left.

Cheers,

_Kevin_
