Apache Ant is the build scripting tool for Java. Available as open source but enhanced and supported by commercial vendors, Ant is the number one choice for thousands of Java projects. Although Ant is undoubtedly feature rich and powerful, it is often difficult to know how best to integrate and apply Ant to your own project environment. This book aims to fill that gap by explaining just what you need to know to make the most of this powerful tool.
