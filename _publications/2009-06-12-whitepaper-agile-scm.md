It does not seem long ago that agile development methods were introduced as new and somewhat controversial mechanisms for delivering 
software development projects. Today however, agile development practices such as incremental development, test driven development, 
refactoring and continuous integration are commonplace and have been accepted and absorbed as commonsense approaches to software development. 
Whatever your beliefs or experience, you cannot deny that agile development projects can and have proved successful in delivering functionality 
on time and to budget. 

This whitepaper discusses a specific aspect of agile development - the concept of Agile Software Configuration Management, or Agile SCM - 
a well-designed, light form of SCM that can be used by software development projects practicing agile development methods. 
In particular it discusses how Agile SCM can be successfully implemented not just on individual projects but across projects in large 
enterprise organizations where specific operational and governance requirements need to be met.
