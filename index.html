## Welcome to my page

I have 25 years of experience in defining, architecting and implementing software technology solutions.
Although a Technologist at heart my real passion is in applying technology to help solve real world
business problems. On this site you will find links and downloads to templates, books, presentations,
code and other collateral that I have created over the years.
